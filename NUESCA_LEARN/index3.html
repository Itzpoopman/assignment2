      <h2><strong>Who was Kobe Bean Bryant</strong></h2>
      <p id="text">
        Kobe Bean Bryant (August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020) was an American
        professional basketball player. A shooting guard, he spent his entire
        20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers in the National Basketball
        Association (NBA). Widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball
        players of all time. Bryant won five NBA championships, was an 18-time
        All-Star, a 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, a 12-time member of the
        All-Defensive Team, the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), and a
        two-time NBA Finals MVP. Bryant also led the NBA in scoring twice, and
        ranks fourth in league all-time regular season and postseason scoring.
        He was posthumously voted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of
        Fame in 2020 and named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team in 2021.

      <h2><strong>Early life</strong></h2>
      <p id="text">
        Kobe Bean Bryant was born on August 23, 1978, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Bryant was the youngest of three
        children
        and the only son of Pamela Cox Bryant and former NBA player Joe Bryant. He was also the maternal nephew of NBA
        player
        John "Chubby" Cox. His parents named him after the famous beef of Kobe, Japan, which they saw on a restaurant
        menu. His
        middle name, Bean, was derived from his father's nickname "Jellybean. In 1984, after ending his NBA career, the
        elder
        Bryant took the family to Italy, where he played in the Italian League. Growing up in Italy alongside two
        athletic
        older
        sisters, Shaya and Sharia, Bryant was an avid player of both basketball and soccer. When the family returned to
        Philadelphia in 1991, Bryant joined the Lower Merion High School basketball team, leading it to the state
        championships
        four years in a row. With an eye on the NBA, he also started working out with the 76ers.Though he boasted good
        grades
        and high SAT scores, Bryant decided to go straight to the NBA from high school. He was selected by the Charlotte
        Hornets
        with the 13th overall pick of the 1996 NBA draft and was subsequently traded to the Los Angeles Lakers.

      <h2><strong>NBA Career and Stats</strong></h2>
      <p id="text">
        In his second season with the Lakers, Bryant was voted a starter for the 1998 All-Star Game, becoming the
        youngest
        All-Star in NBA history at 19. The shooting guard then teamed up with superstar center Shaquille O'Neal to win
        three
        consecutive NBA championships and was voted first-team all-NBA from 2002-2004. He also inked multi-year
        endorsement
        deals with Adidas, Sprite and other top sponsors.
        Although the Lakers struggled after O'Neal left in 2004, Bryant performed brilliantly. He scored 81 points
        against the
        Toronto Raptors in January 2006, the second-highest single-game mark in NBA history, and led the league in
        scoring that
        year and the next.
        In 2008, Bryant was named Most Valuable Player and carried his team to the NBA Finals, where they lost to the
        Boston
        Celtics. In the 2009 NBA Finals, the Lakers beat the Orlando Magic to win the championship. Shortly afterward,
        Bryant
        was part of the memorial service to honor friend and music superstar Michael Jackson. The following year, the
        Lakers won
        their second straight title by defeating the Celtics.
        Bryant played on both the 2008 and 2012 U.S. Olympic teams, winning consecutive gold medals with teammates Kevin
        Durant,
        LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony, among several other top players.
        After suffering a torn Achilles tendon in April 2013, Bryant worked hard to return to the court before
        fracturing his
        knee just six games into the 2013-2014 season. The veteran All-Star surpassed Michael Jordan for third all-time
        on the
        NBA scoring list in December 2014, but his season ended due to injury for the third straight year when he
        sustained a
        torn rotator cuff in January 2015.

      <h2><strong>Retirement</strong></h2>
      <p id="text">
        Although Bryant returned in time for the start of the 2015-2016 NBA season, he personally struggled alongside
        his young
        Lakers teammates. In November 2015, he announced that he would retire at the end of the season. "This season is
        all I
        have left to give," he wrote on The Players' Tribune website. "My heart can take the pounding. My mind can
        handle the
        grind but my body knows it's time to say goodbye."
        The announcement drew a strong reaction, particularly from NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. "With 17 NBA All-Star
        selections, an NBA MVP, five NBA championships with the Lakers, two Olympic gold medals and a relentless work
        ethic,
        Kobe Bryant is one of the greatest players in the history of our game," Silver said in a statement. "Whether
        competing
        in the finals or hoisting jump shots after midnight in an empty gym, Kobe has an unconditional love for the
        game."
        On April 13, 2016, Bryant dazzled a sold-out crowd at the Staples Center and fans everywhere in the last game of
        his
        career, scoring 60 points and leading the Lakers to a win against the Utah Jazz. It was Bryant’s sixth 60-point
        game of
        his career.
